# Task 6 Implementation: Re-ranking Service with Cross-Encoder

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 6: "Implement re-ranking service with cross-encoder" from the adaptive-question-system spec. This task involves creating a sophisticated re-ranking service that uses cross-encoder models to improve the relevance of retrieved candidates.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Cross-Encoder Re-ranking Service (`app/services/reranking_service.py`)

A comprehensive re-ranking service that uses state-of-the-art cross-encoder models for relevance scoring.

#### Key Features:
- **Cross-Encoder Model Integration**: Uses `sentence-transformers` CrossEncoder for relevance scoring
- **Batch Inference**: Optimized batch processing for performance
- **Intelligent Caching**: TTL-based caching with automatic cleanup
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust error handling with heuristic fallbacks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive statistics and metrics tracking
- **Async/Await Support**: Non-blocking operations for better scalability

#### Core Methods:

##### `rerank_candidates()`
Main entry point for re-ranking candidates:
```python
async def rerank_candidates(
    query_context: Dict[str, Any],
    candidates: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
    max_k: int = 40,
    use_cache: bool = True
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

##### `_batch_predict()`
Optimized batch inference with memory management:
- Processes candidates in configurable batches (default: 32)
- Uses asyncio executor to avoid blocking
- Handles memory constraints for large candidate sets

##### `_combine_scores()`
Sophisticated score fusion combining multiple signals:
- **Cross-encoder score** (40% weight): Deep semantic relevance
- **Retrieval score** (25% weight): Original BM25/dense scores  
- **Skill match score** (15% weight): Alignment with target skills
- **Difficulty match score** (15% weight): Optimal difficulty for user
- **Freshness score** (5% weight): Content recency

#### Advanced Features:

##### Smart Query Building
Constructs rich query representations from user context:
```python
def _build_query_text(self, query_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    # Combines: explicit query + target skills + difficulty level + 
    # language preference + error profile focus areas
```

##### Candidate Text Construction  
Creates comprehensive candidate descriptions:
```python
def _build_candidate_text(self, candidate: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    # Includes: type + skills + difficulty + language + 
    # bloom level + CEFR level + content preview
```

##### Intelligent Caching
- **Cache Key Generation**: MD5 hash of query + candidate IDs
- **TTL Management**: 1-hour expiration with automatic cleanup
- **Size Management**: LRU-style eviction when cache grows too large
- **Hit Rate Tracking**: Performance monitoring for cache effectiveness

### 2. Enhanced Orchestration Service Integration

Updated the orchestration service to use the new re-ranking service:

#### New Methods:
- `_build_rerank_query()`: Constructs query for re-ranking from user context
- `_fallback_reranking()`: Heuristic-based fallback when cross-encoder fails

#### Enhanced `_reranking_phase()`:
```python
async def _reranking_phase(self, candidates, user_context, request_id):
    # Build rich query context
    query_context = {
        "query": self._build_rerank_query(user_context),
        "target_skills": user_context.get("target_skills", []),
        "theta_math": user_context.get("theta_math", 0.0),
        "error_profiles": user_context.get("error_profiles", {})
    }
    
    # Perform cross-encoder re-ranking with timeout
    reranked_candidates = await asyncio.wait_for(
        reranking_service.rerank_candidates(...),
        timeout=rerank_timeout
    )
```

### 3. API Endpoint Enhancement

Updated the `/recommend/rerank` endpoint to use the cross-encoder service:

#### Before (Heuristic):
```python
# Simple heuristic scoring
heuristic_score = base_score + random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1)
```

#### After (Cross-Encoder):
```python
# Use cross-encoder re-ranking service
reranked_candidates = await reranking_service.rerank_candidates(
    query_context=request.query_repr,
    candidates=request.candidates,
    max_k=request.max_k,
    use_cache=True
)
```

## Technical Architecture

### Model Configuration
- **Default Model**: `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`
- **Device**: Auto-detection (CUDA if available, CPU fallback)
- **Batch Size**: 32 (configurable)
- **Max Length**: 512 tokens

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Lazy Model Loading
```python
async def _load_model(self):
    async with self._loading_lock:
        if self._model_loaded:
            return
        # Load model in executor to avoid blocking
        self.model = await loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: CrossEncoder(...))
```

#### 2. Batch Processing
- Processes candidates in batches to manage memory
- Configurable batch size based on available resources
- Async execution to maintain responsiveness

#### 3. Intelligent Caching
- Cache key based on query + candidate fingerprint
- TTL-based expiration (1 hour default)
- Automatic cache cleanup and size management
- Cache hit rate monitoring

### Error Handling & Resilience

#### Multi-Level Fallbacks:
1. **Model Loading Failure**: Graceful degradation to heuristic scoring
2. **Inference Failure**: Fallback to retrieval scores + heuristics  
3. **Timeout**: Return partial results or fallback ranking
4. **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch size and retry

#### Monitoring & Observability:
```python
def get_stats(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        "model_loaded": self._model_loaded,
        "total_requests": self.stats["total_requests"],
        "cache_hit_rate": cache_hit_rate,
        "avg_latency_ms": self.stats["avg_latency_ms"],
        "model_load_time": self.stats["model_load_time"]
    }
```

## Score Fusion Strategy

The re-ranking service combines multiple relevance signals:

### 1. Cross-Encoder Score (40%)
- Deep semantic understanding of query-candidate relevance
- Trained on large-scale relevance datasets
- Captures nuanced semantic relationships

### 2. Retrieval Score (25%)  
- Original BM25 + dense embedding scores
- Provides baseline relevance signal
- Fast to compute, good coverage

### 3. Skill Match Score (15%)
- Jaccard similarity between candidate skills and target skills
- Ensures alignment with learning objectives
- Personalized to user's current focus areas

### 4. Difficulty Match Score (15%)
- Optimal difficulty based on user's theta (IRT ability)
- Promotes appropriate challenge level
- Supports adaptive learning progression

### 5. Freshness Score (5%)
- Promotes newer content when available
- Prevents staleness in recommendations
- Configurable based on content strategy

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency Targets:
- **Cold Start**: < 2s (model loading)
- **Warm Inference**: < 200ms (batch of 32)
- **Cache Hit**: < 10ms
- **Fallback**: < 50ms

### Throughput:
- **Batch Size**: 32 candidates per batch
- **Concurrent Requests**: Async processing supports multiple concurrent requests
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB for model + batch processing

### Cache Performance:
- **Hit Rate Target**: > 60% for production workloads
- **TTL**: 1 hour (configurable)
- **Max Size**: 10,000 entries (configurable)

## Configuration Options

```python
class RerankingService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_name = "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2"
        self.batch_size = 32
        self.max_length = 512
        self.cache_ttl = timedelta(hours=1)
        self.max_cache_size = 10000
```
