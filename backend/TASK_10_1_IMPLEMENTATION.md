# Task 10.1 Implementation: Main Recommendation Pipeline

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 10.1: "Implement main recommendation pipeline" from the adaptive-question-system spec. The task involves creating an orchestrator service that coordinates all components in the recommendation pipeline.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Orchestration Service (`app/services/orchestration_service.py`)

The `RecommendationPipeline` class was already well-implemented but has been enhanced with:

#### Core Pipeline Flow
- **retrieval → re-ranking → diversification → bandit selection**
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Timeout handling for each phase
- Comprehensive metrics collection

#### Key Methods Enhanced:
- `recommend_next_questions()` - Main entry point with full pipeline orchestration
- `_retrieval_phase()` - Added timeout handling and better error recovery
- `_reranking_phase()` - Heuristic-based scoring (cross-encoder will be added in task 6)
- `_diversification_phase()` - MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) implementation
- `_bandit_selection_phase()` - LinUCB integration with robust error handling
- `_generation_fallback()` - Automatic question generation when needed
- `_emergency_fallback()` - Last resort fallback mechanism

#### New Features Added:
- **Phase Metrics Calculation**: Tracks performance of each pipeline phase
- **Robust Error Handling**: Each phase has proper error recovery
- **Timeout Management**: Prevents hanging on external service calls
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple levels of fallback when components fail

### 2. API Endpoints Implementation (`app/api/v1/recommend.py`)

Completely implemented the recommendation API endpoints:

#### `/recommend/next` (POST)
- **Purpose**: Main recommendation endpoint
- **Integration**: Connects to orchestration service
- **Features**:
  - Request validation
  - Structured error responses
  - Performance logging
  - Proper response formatting

#### `/recommend/search` (POST)
- **Purpose**: Hybrid search endpoint
- **Integration**: Connects to retrieval service
- **Features**:
  - Parameter validation
  - Search result formatting
  - Error handling

#### `/recommend/rerank` (POST)
- **Purpose**: Re-ranking endpoint (placeholder for task 6)
- **Features**:
  - Heuristic-based scoring
  - Proper response structure
  - Ready for cross-encoder integration

### 3. Error Handling & Resilience

#### Multi-Level Fallback Strategy:
1. **Phase-level fallbacks**: Each phase handles its own failures
2. **Pipeline-level fallbacks**: Generation fallback when not enough items
3. **Emergency fallback**: Basic question generation as last resort

#### Error Response Structure:
```json
{
  "code": "RECOMMENDATION_PIPELINE_ERROR",
  "message": "Failed to generate recommendations",
  "request_id": "uuid-here",
  "details": {"error": "specific error message"}
}
```

#### Timeout Management:
- Configurable timeouts for external service calls
- Graceful degradation when services are slow
- Prevents cascade failures

### 4. Monitoring & Observability

#### Pipeline Metrics:
- **Performance**: Total pipeline time, phase-specific timings
- **Quality**: Retrieval scores, re-ranking scores, diversity scores
- **Efficiency**: Phase conversion ratios, fallback usage
- **Bandit**: Propensity scores, exploration ratios

#### Logging Strategy:
- Structured logging with request IDs
- Debug logs for each pipeline phase
- Error logs with full context
- Performance metrics logging

## Configuration

The pipeline is configurable through the `config` dictionary:

```python
self.config = {
    "retrieval_k": 200,        # Candidates from retrieval
    "rerank_k": 40,           # Candidates after re-ranking
    "diversification_k": 20,   # Candidates after diversification
    "final_k": 5,             # Final recommendations
    "generation_fallback": True, # Enable generation fallback
    "cache_ttl": 300,         # Cache TTL in seconds
    "timeout_seconds": 10     # Timeout for external calls
}
```

## API Usage Examples

### Recommend Next Questions
```bash
POST /v1/recommend/next
{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "target_skills": ["linear_equation", "algebra"],
  "constraints": {"language": "tr"},
  "personalization": {"difficulty_preference": "adaptive"}
}
```

### Search Questions
```bash
POST /v1/recommend/search
{
  "query": "linear equation",
  "goals": {"target_skills": ["algebra"]},
  "lang": "tr",
  "k": 50
}
```

## Error Handling Examples

### Pipeline Failure Response
```json
{
  "detail": {
    "code": "RECOMMENDATION_PIPELINE_ERROR",
    "message": "Failed to generate recommendations",
    "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "details": {"error": "Retrieval service timeout"}
  }
}
```

### Validation Error Response
```json
{
  "detail": "user_id is required"
}
```

## Testing

### Structure Validation
- Created `test_pipeline_structure.py` to validate code structure
- Verifies all required classes and methods exist
- Checks proper imports and integration

### Manual Testing
- Created `test_recommendation_pipeline.py` for functional testing
- Includes mocking for external dependencies
- Tests error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the spec:

- **Requirement 1.1**: IRT-based student profiling integration
- **Requirement 1.3**: Diversification and curriculum coverage
- **Requirement 2.2**: English question recommendation support
- **Requirement 7.1**: Bandit algorithm integration for adaptive selection

## Next Steps

1. **Task 6**: Implement cross-encoder re-ranking service
2. **Task 9**: Complete English cloze generation service
3. **Task 11.2**: Add authentication and authorization
4. **Task 13**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and metrics
